"Alright guys, *cough* I'm doing 'Take On Me' now, alright. I, I really, I really like this song. It sounds good."
Minin' away
I don't know what to mine
I'll mine this anyway
In this Minecraft day
So beautiful, mine further down
What's that I found?
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!
So easy to mine
With my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels
Hopefully they stay
In my Minecraft chests
So I'm gonna make
A lock on it
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!
"Ah! *cough, cough, cough, cough, sniff, cough*
I'm alright, I'm ready"
All these diamonds
Sittin' carefully lay
I'm getting worried (Shut the fucking door!)
If they might get stolen
From my ender chest
Wait, who is that?
Holy sheep, it's Notch!
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Now they're safe
*screaming*
Now
Now that they're safe
*screaming*
Mine diamonds, *heavy breathing* (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Uh, thanks, thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song
