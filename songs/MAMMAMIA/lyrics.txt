Uh, uh, uh, uh
Oh, mamma mia, ma-ma-mamma mia, ah
I feel the heat, uh, I feel the beat of drums
Call the police, I'll do it, they've stolen all my fun
I'm breaking free, but I'm stuck in the police car
Oh, mamma mia, ma-ma-mamma mia, ah
They treat me like if I did something criminal
All eyes on me, I feel like I'm a superstar
I'm not a freak, I just thought it was carnival
Oh, mamma-mamma mia, spit your love on me
I'm on my knees and I can't wait to drink your rain
I'll keep the secret if you let me get a taste
Tell me your limits and we'll cross that line again
Oh, mamma-mamma mia (Hahaha)
Oh, mamma mia, ma-ma-mamma mia, ah
You wanna touch my body, I say you're not allowed
You wanna handle me, but I'm a bit too much
I burned all the place down 'cause I'm too fucking hot
Oh, mamma mia, ma-ma-mamma mia, ah
They wanna arrest me, but I was just having fun
I swear that I'm not drunk and I'm not taking drugs
They ask me why I'm so hot, 'cause I'm italiano
Oh, mamma-mamma mia, spit your love on me
I'm on my knees and I can't wait to drink your rain
I'll keep the secret if you let me get a taste
Tell me your limits and we'll cross that line again
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
Give me a command and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favourite music's your, "Uh, uh"
Give me a command and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favourite music's your, "Uh, uh"
Give me a command and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favourite music's your, "Uh, uh"
Give me a command and I'll do what you ask
'Cause I love when you sing out loud
Oh, mamma-mamma mia, spit your love on me
I'm on my knees and I can't wait to drink your rain
I'll keep the secret if you let me get a taste
Tell me your limits and we'll cross that line again
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
