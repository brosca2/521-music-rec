I don't want a friend
I want my life in two (Please, one more night; my life in two)
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (I done fighted all night; waiting for you)
(I done fighted all night)
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
When you gotta run (Gotta run, gotta run)
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out, you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
Yeah
Used to be the one (Used to be the one)
To hold you when you fall, yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
