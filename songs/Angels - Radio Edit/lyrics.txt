Wild angels, wild wild angels
Ooh
Wild angels, wild wild angels
I'm new in town, can't you see?
I've got no one to take care of me
Across the deserts and the ocean blue
But I never met a girl like you
I'm a stranger, and I must confess
I always take all, I won't take less
Maybe it's forever or just one night only
Babe, it's all you're lonely
Wild angels keep flying
From darkness to heavens high
Wild angels keep trying
To make it, to make it through the night
What can I do?
I'm falling for you
Oh, baby, it's true
Ooh
I'm a stranger, but I know you well
Maybe it's the truth -- I want you to tell
I rode my waves across rivers, too
Never found a girl like you
I'm a stranger, but I save your love
If you're fightin' for the light
Maybe forever or just one night only
Babe, don't you know me?
Wild angels keep flying
From darkness to heavens high
Wild angels keep trying
To make it, to make it through the night
What can I do?
I'm falling for you
Oh, baby, it's true
Ooh
Wild angels, wild wild angels
Ooh, wild wild angels
Wild angels, wild wild angels
Wild angels keep flying
From darkness to heavens high
Wild angels keep trying
To make it, to make it through the night
What can I do?
I'm falling for you
Oh, baby, it's true
Ooh
Wild angels, wild wild angels
Ooh, wild wild angels
