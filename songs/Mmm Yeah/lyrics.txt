Austin M, keep doing your thing
Let these boys keep slippin', man
I'm not into gymnastics
But I'm into flippin' things
I tell these women that it's all about a team
Jordan and Pippen, man
So do you wanna join the team?
Now tell me, Little Miss Thang, dale
When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak
I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
All that I could say was
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
All that I could say was
Rock and roll one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it 'cause I mean what I say, say (Say, say)
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walks past me I say, "He-hey, hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey)
So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like I ain't said a word, stood there like, "Man"
Girl, I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place, like, man
When I saw her (Saw her)
Walking down the street (Down the street)
She looked so fine (Looked so fine)
I just had to speak
I asked her name (Name)
But she turned away

All that I could say was
Six-inch heels clickin' up-down the street
You know she's comin', and then she walks away, 'way ('Way, 'way)
Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I say, say (Say, say, say)
So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like I ain't said a word, stood there like, "Man"
Girl, I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place, like, man
When I saw her (I saw her)
Walking down the street (Down the street)
She looked so fine (Looked so fine, yeah)

But she turned away (Hey)

She looks so good, but she bad, bad
You can see that back from the front, front
Booty like Kris Kross, jump, jump (Ha)
Meet me in the middle of the ocean, we can
Find ourselves and lose our minds, rewind
Wa-wa-wa-wa, play
Find ourselves and lose our minds today, hey
Austin M. and Armando acabando
Latinos y gringos gozando, Â¿me entiendes? (Woo)
For those that thought that we would stop
Definitely don't have a mind to think with, brainless (Ha-ha)
Most of them broke, but they're famous (That's right)
Some got hits, but they're nameless (That's right)
But, Mamita, forget about that, when I seen you
All that I could say was
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm-mmm, yeah, yeah
All that I could say was
