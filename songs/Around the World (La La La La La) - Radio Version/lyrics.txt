The kisses of the sun
Were sweet, I didn't blink
I let it in no eyes
Like an exotic trick
The radio playin’ songs
That I have never heard
I don't know what to say
Oh, not another word
Just la, la, la, la, la
It goes around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
It's all around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
And everybody’s singin'
La, la, la, la, la
And now the bells are ringin'
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Inside an empty room
My inspiration flows, now, wait to hear the tune
Around my head it goes, a magic melody
You want to sing with me, just la, la, la, la, la
The music is the key
And now the night is gone
Still it goes on and on
So deep in strategy
I won't just sedigree
I don't know what to do
Just can't explain to you
I don't know what to say
Oh, not anothеr word
Just la, la, la, la, la
It goes around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
It's all around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
And еverybody’s singin’
La, la, la, la, la
And now the bells are ringin'
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
The kisses of the sun
Around, around, around...
La, la, la, la, la
It goes around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
It’s all around the world
Just la, la, la, la, la
And everybody's singin'
La, la, la, la, la
And now the bells are ringin'
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Around, around, around, around, around...)
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la – la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
